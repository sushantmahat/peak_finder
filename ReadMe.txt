the input.py script is desigend to process data in bulk.

That code will take in a folder path containg 
several data sets beginning with the same keyword. 
It will then reformat the data so it is compatible with the "main.py" script.

Time step between data points, range of data points, and the signal-to-noise to determine peaks can be changed in this folder.


The main.py script has functon defintions thatr run a FFT on the data, and finds/prints  peaks.
